# Overview

Here I built a API copier / web scaper. I recently bult a news app in kotlin and I wanted to be able to pull the websites from a free source I could provide. So I created this python file to scrape the API and the web for the news articles and put them into a json file so I could desplay them.

This will add to the productivity and the scalibility of my app
